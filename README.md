Personal Profile App
This project is an interactive web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to demonstrate front-end web development skills. The main goal is to create a dynamic personal profile form with validation and data display capabilities.

Features
Attractive User Interface: Uses modern styles inspired by SaaS designs to create a clean and beautiful user experience.

Real-time Input Validation: Text fields (for name, last name, job, and friends) automatically prevent the entry of numbers and extra spaces, ensuring that data is always clean and valid.

Smart Calculations: The application calculates the user's age and the remaining years until retirement (based on age 65).

Profile Summary Display: After the form is filled out, a comprehensive summary of the person's profile, including their driver's license status and number of friends, is displayed.

Single-File Project: All the code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is contained within a single file, making the project easy to use and share.

Project Structure
The project consists of three main parts, all located within a single file (person_profile_app.html):

HTML: Provides the core structure and form elements.

CSS: Manages the look and design of the application using the Tailwind CSS framework and custom styles.

JavaScript: Responsible for the application's logic, input validation, calculations, and displaying the final results on the page.

Installation and Usage
To run this project, simply open the person_profile_app.html file in your web browser. No additional tools or servers are required, as all dependencies (like Tailwind CSS) are loaded via a CDN.

How to Use
Open the person_profile_app.html file.

Enter your personal information into the respective fields.

Click the "Create Profile" button.

Your profile summary will be displayed at the bottom of the page.
